i) What I like about github is that it is very easy to use, has a great UI, and is the best version control system to exist. 

ii) What I dislike about github is how merge conflicts need to be resolved and resolving them using the command line. I also don't like how ssh commands and passkey's work.

iii) One question I have regarding github is how much space all this code takes. Is there a limit on the amount of code files or repositories created in the future for github?
